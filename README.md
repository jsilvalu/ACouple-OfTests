## :open_file_folder: About The Project

The following project contains the development of un API testing challenge and another related on Selenium Webdriver.

## :white_check_mark: Getting Started

### Installation

_To prepare the necessary environment for the execution of the process you can follow the steps below: ._

1. **Access** to [my repository](https://github.com/jsilvalu/ACouple-OfTests)
2. **Clone** the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jsilvalu/ACouple-OfTests
   ```
   
3. Install **Python** from the official site:
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

4. Install **Selenium Webdriver** packages:
   Via **pip**:
   ```sh
   pip install selenium
   ```

5. Install **webdriver_manager**:

Via **pypi**:
[Download webdriver_manager](https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/)

Via **pip**:

   pip install webdriver-manager
   ```

We use a venv in Python with all the packages installed inside, we can run the virtual environment using:
  ```sh
source env/bin/activate
```
 
## Improvements & Personal note:

There are a lot of possible improvements in these projects but due to time constraints and a couple of problems that I had to solve on the fly it has not been possible:
- Part 1: Apply design pattern, modularise into functions and classes implementation....
- Part 2: Apply design pattern like POM or ScreenPlay, apply different classes and tests, load the resources from a json, configure custom options for the webdriver...
